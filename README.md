# PYODBC and OOP

We are looking into the PYODBC package. 

1) 
And we are going to use the package to make a OOP module that abstracts our interaction with the NW DB. Starting with the connection.

2) 
And then further abstract the interaction with specific Tables. 

3)
Finally, where appropriate we will use the CRUD desing to build methods.


## CRUD
### Create

### READ 
##### READ one
##### READ all

### Update

### Delete
